// The question is to implement a function that will return a new array that removes the unwanted elements. 
//Also, the question provided us with the names of 
//the arguments also known as the paramtere of the function. The first step was to creat a new variable that would hold the new array we will make 
// as we are unaware of the contents of the array, the array is left empty. A for loop was made to loop so that all the elements are looped through. 
//Then an if stament was 
// required as the function had to remove the unwanted items. By stating if (source[i] === itemsToRemove[i]) we are using the index 
//because we are looking at the index of the array. If its not equal then push the new array to our variable sourceWithout. Then we both return and console.log 
//sourceWithout.
